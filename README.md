## Digital Forensics Artifact knowledge base

This project provides [documentation](https://artifacts-kb.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
accompanying [Digital Forensics Artifact Repository](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts).

Scripts and Digital Forensics Artifact knowledge base (artifactsrc) are intended
to help maintain the knowledge base.

### Contributing

If you want to contribute a description of an artifact definition please use
the [Template](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts-kb/blob/master/Template.md).

Create new descriptions under the most specific topic subdirectory under
docs/sources, and update the corresponding index.rst file.

Please do not mention tools that can be used to extract information from the
artifact. The goal of the Digital Forensics Artifact knowledge base is to
describe artifacts, not to provide yet another repository of tools.

Make sure that URLs of referenced sources can be resolved, dead links will
be updated or removed.
